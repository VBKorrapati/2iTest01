 In this code, created a Scanner object to read input from the user and an array to hold the input numbers. Used a for loop to read 10 numbers from the user and store them in the array Then sort the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. We remove duplicates from the array by comparing adjacent elements and storing only the unique elements in the first part of the array. Used a separate counter variable uniqueCount to keep track of the number of unique elements. Finally, we create a new array sortedNumbers to hold the sorted unique elements in descending order. We loop through the unique elements in reverse order and store them in the sortedNumbers array. We then print out the sorted array using a for-each loop
